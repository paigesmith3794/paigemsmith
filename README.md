<h1>My Portfolio</h1>

<h4>My name is Paige Smith. I'm a Full Stack Web Developer most interested in Front-End Web Development and Web Design. 
I enjoy problem-solving in creative ways that challenge me to think outside the box. I'm a team player. Transitioning from my current job as a Staff Research Associate in a UC Davis Health Laboratory, I understand the importance of collaboration, organization, and communication. When I'm not designing and developing websites, you'll find me spending time with friends and family, enjoying a cold beer, playing sports, or relaxing with my doTERRA essential oils.<br><br>

Please see my portfolio website for examples of my web development skills.<br>
