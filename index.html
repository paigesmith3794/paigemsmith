            <h3>Game Research</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
              Oathbreaker is a battle-style browser game. There are so many games within this category, so it required extensive research before development to make sure we could figure out ways to make our game even better. We used other medievel and fantasy themed battle browser games as our guide toward our own vision for our game. My UI/UX partner and I decided to implement animation within the site to appeal to the user's emotions. We wanted to create a foggy dark setting, as though you had just walked through a war zone. We created an entire lore to really bring life to the game for the user.

             I took the lead on designing the user experience routes for Oathbreaker. Click on the image to enlarge in a new tab. Having this typed detailed route guide helped guide our team. We stayed much more focused and productive with this user experience guide as our map toward success of our final product.

            <h3>Webflow Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
              My UI/UX partner and I used Webflow to make prototypes of each web page before developing it in code. Creating the prototype allowed fro us to visualize what we were imagining in our minds, so the entire team was on the same page with where the design was progressing. I enjoy using prototypes because it really allows for everyone to understand the vision of the UI/UX designer.

            <h3>Brainstorming The Problem & sketching solutions</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
             Within a team, I feel it's best to brainstorm together before starting any other development task. Our team found there was a need for a website people can use when they need an outfit for a specific occasion, but don't have time to go to the store to search for one. 
             So, off we went to start the project. My personal design process usually starts with me sketching out my initial ideas, then the sketch leads me to prototyping within Webflow, Adobe Suite, InVision or any other design tool.

            <h3>Fashion Design Research</h3>
            <p>
              I was very involved with the design research for this project. Our concept required me to inform the team of fashion trends, so we could include them in the overall design. Many of the outfits you are able to search in the app are from my extensive reserach.

             I added media queries to the CSS code for this project, so the app would be completely mobile responsive. This was important to our entire team because we wanted users to access the app anywhere at anytime.

            <h3>DESIGN DETAILS MATTER</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            When I build an app, the smallest details matter because I believe it can make or break you. One small detailed mistake could turn into a huge mistake in minutes. With my background in laboratory management, I am extremely detail oriented. I demonstrate this skill in all my web development projects. 
            Specifically, for No-Tify, my team and I chose to use a dolphin as the logo because dolphins are intelligent and symbolize balance. We want the user to feel they have complete control over every task.

              I implemented the email validation API. The implimentation of email validation saves time and minimizes headaches by automating the task of pruning email list data.

              I have the idea to implement a google calendar API, so when the user adds a reminder, then the application can automatically update their google calendar if requested by the user.
